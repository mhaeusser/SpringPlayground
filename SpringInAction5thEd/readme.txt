This folder contains the code samples for Craig Wall's book "Spring in Action", 5th edition.

I downloaded the code from github.com/habuma/spring-in-action-5-samples and:
- changed the indenting to 4 spaces
- removed some whitespace
- removed the .mvn folders and the mvnw[.cmd] files.
So an installation of mvn is needed.

To make the main methods and unit tests runnable from IntelliJ: Select the pom.xml file, choose "Add as Maven project"
